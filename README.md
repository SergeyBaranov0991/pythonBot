# pythonBot
This is the main branch, which must include all rested and stabilized packages

This bot is hosted on cloud, so you may check PROD functionality as a user: @reminder_KSA_bot

Disclaimer: due to this is my sand-box to learn python and literally first experience in software development, it contains a lot of non-optimal solutions. Please be kind :)
